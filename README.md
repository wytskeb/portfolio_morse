# portfolio_morse

This repository contains both an API and a client. The API provides functionality to convert between plain text and morse code. The client provides a simple command line interface to this API, allowing users to convert text into morse and vice versa.

The API and client use a shared key for getting tokens that will expire after a while and will be automigically be renewed. The `tokens.py` file contains a nice class to handle tokens and is used by the API.

I built this repository as part of my portfolio for my 100 Days of Python training (Udemy). I wanted to have a space where I could showcase my skills and projects in a more interactive and personal way than a resume or LinkedIn profile.
